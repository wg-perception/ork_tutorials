Object Recognition Kitchen (ORK) Tutorials
##########################################

Welcome to the ORK Tutorials! These tutorials are designed to show how to use
specific tools and detection pipelines that are part of
:ref:`ORK <orkcore:index>`.

The following tutorials do not go over the object recognition steps in order of
execution but complexity. You probably need the last tutorials for your real
world applications, but the first tutorials are simpler, and will make sure
that your system is set up correctly.
